# Gender-Classifier

For the give task I have taken two datasets which contains name and gender of 'male' and 'females'.

the dataset are pre processed by taking only first names and combining the two data set
male is assigned 0
female is assigned 1

I have then used a bigram feature extraction method using the sci-kit learn package

This gives a training set which can be used to train a classifier

I have used Logisitic Regression classifier from sci-kit learn package

Input: 'http://0.0.0.0:5000/Priya'
Output: 'Female'

P.S: I can further improve the accuracy of the model using Neural Nets and have other ideas as well to train the model
